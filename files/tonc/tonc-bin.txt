// === Description ===
  Tonc is a tutorial for learning how to program for the GameBoy Advance
(GBA). It covers most aspects of the GBA, often in great detail and 
from an efficiency orientated viewpoint. Among other things, you'll 
see all video modes (0-6), sprites, simple and advanced button 
handling, Rotation/Scaling for backgrounds and sprites (covered the 
_right_ way for a change), mode 7 and programming in ARM assembly.

  Tonc consists of 3 parts: text, code and binaries. Tonc is part of
http://www.coranac.com/ where you can find the on-line text, as
well as zips for the three parts. This readme belongs to the code 
part of the set.

NOTE: this is still a only a beta, though should be close to the
final version.

// === Tonc binaries (tonc-bin.zip) ---
These are the binaries of all the tonc-code projects, compiled to 
multi-bootable form. They should run on emulators and hardware 
alike.
